Todo:
- move development server from blot.development to blot.dev so that google will allow the redirect URL

Questions
- is there an overhead to creating the oauth2 client each time? can we safely reuse it?
- is it possible to restrict Blot's access to a single folder in the google drive?
  - it doesn't seem like it is
