# Project management

I haven't found the need to use a complicated piece of software to manage the daily operation of Blot. I use email heavily, and a text-file to record my outstanding tasks.

## Task tracking

I use a text-file to keep track of my tasks. This text-file is checked into version control. If somebody needs to be notified when a task is complete, I include a link to the appropriate email thread in the task.

## Email

My email inbox only contains email to which I need to respond. Once I respond to an email, it is archived. If there is a longer task which I need to complete, I will make an entry in *todo.txt* with a link to the archived email thread, so I can follow up with the customer when the task is complete.
