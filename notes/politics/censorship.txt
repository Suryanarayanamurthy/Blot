# Censorship

Blot has been running for a while now and there is plenty published on it that I dislike, material that will cause real harm. However, on balance, I believe the harm is preferable than the harm of a censorship regime needed to prevent it.

This is one reason why I avoided depending on advertisers to fund Blot. The large businesses that tend to buy advertising are risky patrons. They always impose a regime of censorship in their own bland interests which tend to push down on all that is against the grain. I'm motivated to provide a platform for the radical and avant-garde even if it means tolerating profanity.

## But what if a country threatens to block Blot?

At some point in future, I suspect Blot will be blocked in one country or another. Perhaps some government official will ask me to block or remove some content from the site. Plenty of tech companies with idealistic mission statements seem to get hung up on this sort of thing – I think it's understandable, when you have employees whose livelihoods depend on the continued growth of their employer. But I don't plan on ever making money in the sorts of markets in which this is likely to happen, so it won't matter much to me if they choose to seal themselves off from Blot.


## But Blot's a private company, why care about free speech?

Because I think the principle of free speech is a good principle. I don't want to live in a society in which a variety of though is constrained into dull concensus.

## But what about extremists?

The toughest question to answer then is this: will you allow the extremist groups to host websites on Blot? Yes. As long as it is perfectly legal in these United States to express oneself as a member of a such a group, it will be possible to do so on Blot.
