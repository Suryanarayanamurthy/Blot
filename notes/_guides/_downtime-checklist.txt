# Downtime checklist

Questions to answer:

Can you SSH into the instance?
- if not, try 'stopping' then 'starting' the instance through AWS, which is different to a system 'reboot' and may provision new hardware for the instance

Can you OS-level reboot the instance?
- if not, try 'stopping' then 'starting' the instance through AWS, which is different to a system 'reboot' and may provision new hardware for the instance

Does the instance have free disk space?
- if not, trying removing log files

Does the instance have free memory?
- if not, try reseting blogs' search index

What do you see in the logs?
- resolve any obvious issues

Check AWS console cloudwatch metrics:
- Do you see inbound network packets (is this a networking issue?) on AWS cloudwatch metrics
- Do you see elevated or missing CPU usage information on AWS cloudwatch metrics for the instance
- Are there obvious patterns to these metrics?
