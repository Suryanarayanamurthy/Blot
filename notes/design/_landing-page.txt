# Landing page references

[Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) - Stole much of the copy from their terms page and privacy policy. Macej's design 'philosophy' was also influential. If I could only steal his sense of humour.

[Kirby](http://getkirby.com) - Stole some of their marketing copy. Looking back, they're likely the subliminal inspiration for Blot's first logo.
